<p class="mb-4">Nights at sea create a sense of adventure and can be calmer than those spent in a busy harbor. Before anchoring, be aware of the weather and sea bed conditions in the area.

<h3><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> Can I dock anywhere in the harbor?</h3>
<p class="mb-4">You should inquire in advance of stopping in a harbor and contact their offices about how to apply and be assigned a place. The cost depends on the area and the size of the boat and can vary from anything between 10 and 150 euros and you may have to pay extra for electricity.</p>
