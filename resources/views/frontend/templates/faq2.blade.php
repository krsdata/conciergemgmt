<h3><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> What time of year should I plan my trip?</h3>
<p class="mb-4">If you wish to embark on a Friday or Saturday or Sunday we suggest to book as soon as you know or as soon as possible. Weekends absolutely sell out so if you want one of our newer boats we suggest you book early in the season. Our sailing season is from May 1 to October 15th.</p>

<h3><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> What equipment/supplies will I need?</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Have a look at our Includes and Not Included section of each boat for details.</p>

<h3><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> How much shall I budget for the trip?</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Price is an important factor when planning a sailing trip. You should set a clear budget from the beginning and allow for all the necessary additional costs such as fuel, gratuity and dining expenses. We list the costs on each and every boat so only you know what your comfort level or ability to pay level is.</p>

<h3><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> What are the methods of payment?</h3>
<p class="mb-4">You are able to pay for your boat in 2 ways â€“ via PayPal or by credit card (MasterCard, Visa or AMEX). Visit <a class="text-primary" href="https://hamptonsboatrental.com/pay" target="_blank">Make a Payment</a> page for easy-to-use payment interface.</p>

<h3><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> Where shall I leave my car whilst I am sailing?</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Most harbors and marinas have convenient or semi convenient parking facilities. You should check what kind of parking they provide beforehand and be sure not to leave any valuables in the car.</p>

<h3><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> What safety rules apply on board?</h3>
<p class="mb-4">These vary from boat to boat and are based on the size, age and model of the boat. The driving force of the boat and the area you are travelling in also need to be taken into account. You should ask the boat provider for a safety briefing. Rules such as No-Smoking, jumping while boat is moving at high speeds or jumping in the water with a strong current are basic and must-follow rules on all boats.</p>

<h3><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> How do I cure seasickness?</h3>
<p class="mb-4">This unpleasant experience can be prevented and treated. Find out <a class="text-primary" href="faq-hamptons-boat-rental" target="_blank">what to do when suffering from seasickness.</a></p>

<h3><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> Can I take pets on board?</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Always ask YACHTHAMPTON by phone or email if you can take an animal on board before arrival. If you do not ask permission, we may be more inclined to say no and pet care for the time you are away may be hard to find. Multiple high-energy pets can make any boat experience more unsafe than you or we would like. Generally, we are pet-friendly up to 1 pet on most vessels, especially if the pet is subdued.</p>

<h3><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> What should I do if there is something wrong with the boat?</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Usually we will correct any faults immediately before leaving the dock. We mitigate this by providing newer vessels, in some case vessels under 2-3 years old. In exceptions, we can issue a discount, offer more free time, or switch you to one of our other boats. As all boat owners know, boats can be difficult and they are much more complicated than autos and prone to have more issues.  We are experienced in boating so let us work on remedying the situation, while you sit back and relax and enjoy the ocean breezes, a cocktail and your friends.</p>

<h3><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> Is there minimum charter duration?</h3>
<p class="mb-4">It is possible to book short trips, but most charters run for 4 hours as the standard.  We do have some select 3 hour bookings and allow 2 hour bookings off season.</p>

<h3><i class="fas fa-caret-right"></i> How much does it cost to use our platform on hamptonsboatrental.com?</h3>
<p class="mb-4">We do not charge you for the use of the platform â€“ there are no booking fees - the only costs involved are once a boat has been booked and confirmed.</p>
