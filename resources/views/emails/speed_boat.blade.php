                        <p>It is behind Bell and Anchor restaurant.      It is the first set of docks on the left. 22 slips deep.    Slip number 22.      It is a brand new White and Black Sea Ray Sundancer with the name Prop-itous on the back.  That means Good Fortune</p>
                        <p>My cell phone is 631-431-0463 and my captain Sean\'s phone is 631-374-0634, he captains 80% of the charters.  Feel free to group text us when you arrive, otherwise just walk to the boat. </p>

                        <p>The boat comes with a medium sized ice chest so we recommend you bring 2 bags of ice.</p>

                        <p>Also, please be on time, we often schedule trips immediately after yours is scheduled to end so we can NOT add time at the end of your trip if you are late.   (It is unfair to the next group) It is vital you arrive on time.    Thank you for understanding.</p> 

                        <p>Please text us if you need anything or have any requests, we will accommodate you and want you to have an amazing time.  Bring absolutely any food or drink you like with the exception of Red Wine, it stains white boats.</p>

                        <p>Thanks again we look forward to a fun day on the water.</p><br/>
